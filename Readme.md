# Smart Mailbox

This is the final project for the subject _Sistemas Distribuidos y Empotrados_.

This project implements a mailbox where packages can be received, without the receiver being at home.

To do this, the postman can request the user to open the mailbox by pressing a button, and the user can open it remotely with their mobile phone. In addition, if the receiver is not available, he can provide an access code to the postman, to enter it and open the mailbox door.
